This project demonstrates comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python. The notebook walks through data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and insight generation—laying the foundation for predictive modeling and informed decision-making.

Project Goals; Understand dataset structure and variables -- Identify trends, correlations, and patterns -- Detect missing values and outliers -- Generate actionable insights using visual analytics

Technologies Used; Python -- Pandas & NumPy – data manipulation -- Matplotlib, Seaborn, & Plotly – visualization -- Jupyter Notebook – code and commentary interface

Project Structure; eda_python.ipynb – Main Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step analysis -- Folder containing raw or cleaned datasets (CSV/Excel) -– Plots and visual exports

How to Run; Clone the repository -- Set up your environment using: Launch the notebook -- Follow along the annotated EDA steps and explore the visualizations
